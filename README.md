# phishing-detection
This project builds models to detect phishing URLs using a balanced Kaggle dataset of 11,430 URLs with 87 features. The equal split between phishing and safe links ensures unbiased evaluation. This dataset is ideal for rapid experimentation, aided by existing code, and aligns with our cybersecurity focus.
